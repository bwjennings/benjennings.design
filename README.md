# Ben Jennings Design Site

This project is now powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so pages can be written in Markdown.

## Working locally

1. Install Ruby and Bundler.
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

GitHub Pages will automatically build the site using Jekyll whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
