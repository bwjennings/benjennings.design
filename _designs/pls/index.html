          Police Legal Sciences has provided training for law enforcement for 25 years. They began with legal update
          training in only a few states and have since expanded their offerings and reach across North America.

          With their growth, managing and distributing content became increasingly challenging. They needed a more
          scalable solution to make management easier while also giving agencies more options, like adjusting content to
          fit their needs.

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="heading sm">Content mapping</h2>
        <p class="body lg">
          I needed to understand the hierarchy of content organization, as it directly impacted how information is
          presented to different users. To ensure it was accurate, I worked with their team in FigJam to map out the
          relationships between key concepts. This visual map highlights the complexity of the system, from agencies to
          user groups, individual users, courses, and lessons.

        <h2 class="heading sm">Finding the right amount of complexity</h2>
        <p class="body lg">
          This system serves users with different levels of responsibility:
        <ul>
          <li>Global Admins – Manage the entire system</li>
          <li>Agency Admins – Oversee their own users.</li>
          <li>Individuals – Simply consume content.</li>
        </ul>

        As responsibilities decrease, the interface adjusts, providing robust controls for admins while remaining simple
        and intuitive for end users.
