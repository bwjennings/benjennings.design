        <p class="body lg">
          Police Legal Sciences has provided training for law enforcement for 25 years. They began with legal update 
          training in only a few states and have since expanded their offerings and reach across North America.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="heading sm">The problem</h2>
        <p class="body lg">
          With their growth, managing and distributing content became increasingly challenging. They needed a more 
          scalable solution to make management easier while also giving agencies more options, like adjusting content to 
          fit their needs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="heading sm">Content mapping</h2>
        <p class="body lg">
          I needed to understand the hierarchy of content organization, as it directly impacted how information is 
          presented to different users. To ensure it was accurate, I worked with their team in FigJam to map out the 
          relationships between key concepts. This visual map highlights the complexity of the system, from agencies to 
          user groups, individual users, courses, and lessons.

        <h2 class="heading sm">Finding the right amount of complexity</h2>
        <p class="body lg">
          This system serves users with different levels of responsibility:
        </p>
        <ul class="body lg">
          <li>Global Admins – Manage the entire system</li>
          <li>Agency Admins – Oversee their own users.</li>
          <li>Individuals – Simply consume content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body lg">
          As responsibilities decrease, the interface adjusts, providing robust controls for admins while remaining simple 
          and intuitive for end users.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading xs">Example of necessary complexity</h3>
        <p class="body lg">
          In this example, a lesson is being created at a global level and these details will appear the same for everyone on the platform.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="http://localhost:3845/assets/d622cd185532073db18c8dc5e1b3cc86cedd69a2.png" alt="Global lesson creation interface" />
        </figure>

        <p class="body lg">
          That same lesson needs to be customized for an individual agency, allowing changes to due dates, assigned user groups, 
          and other details.
        </p>
        <p class="body lg">
          To visually distinguish an instance we introduced this modal pattern to represent an instance of content.

        <p class="body lg">
          From the agency admin's perspective, the complexity is reduced since they only manage a single version of the lesson.
