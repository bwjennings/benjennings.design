            <p>The existing method for loan officers to create and manage loans required them to use several individual
              tools that required a lot of training. This unorganization caused a lot of frustration for employees as
              well as loan applicants. </p>

            <p>To address this challenge, these processes were moved to the Salesforce platform, allowing everything to
              be managed in one place. Over several months, I designed experiences to handle the complexities of the
              loan process, such as adding collateral, including co-borrowers, and ensuring compliance with all
              regulatory requirements.</p>



            <p>Working within Salesforce comes with certain design constraints. To create an intuitive experience, I
              first
              needed to understand what loan officers aimed to accomplishâ€”for example, gathering all the required
              information for a collateral item. Then, using an understanding of what is possible with salesforce tools
              like Omniscripts, Flexcards, and Lightning Web Components, I then designed solutions that prioritized user
              needs while remaining realistic in terms of development effort.</p>
